    <h2>The Lost Key</h2>
        <p>One afternoon, a young boy named Sam was playing in his backyard when he found an old key buried in the dirt. Curious, he wondered what it could unlock.</p>
        <p>He searched the entire house, trying to find where the key fit. Just as he was about to give up, he noticed a small, hidden door behind the bookshelf in the attic. With trembling hands, Sam inserted the key and turned it slowly. The door creaked open, revealing a room filled with forgotten treasures.</p>
        <p>His adventure had only just begun.</p>
